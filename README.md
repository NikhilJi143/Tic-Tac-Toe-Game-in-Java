Developed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java, implementing fundamental programming concepts such as 2D arrays, control structures, and input handling. The game allows two players to alternately mark spaces on a 3x3 grid, providing real-time validation for moves, ensuring fair gameplay, and determining the winner based on classic game rules. Key features include:

Dynamic board rendering after each move.
Robust input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves.
Efficient algorithms for checking win conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals).
Modular design with reusable methods like printBoard, haveWon, and getRowColFromInput to enhance readability and maintainability.
